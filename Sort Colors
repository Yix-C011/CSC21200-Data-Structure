// The Big-O is O(n) because there are two for loops, not nested, so it would be O(n).

// The space complexity is O(1) because we only used three variable for the algorithm which does not change the size of the vector overall.

// Follow up: We can use one while loop and two pointers, one left pointer and one right pointer. The for loop checks if the number at index i is 0 then swap the number for left pointer and current index, also increase tne left pointer and current index. If the number at index i is 1, i++. If the number is 2, swap the number at current index with the right pointer, then decrease the right pointer.
